# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> Ok start, but lots of tweaks needed and you really should be well into your UI design by now - We've worked on this for five weeks!

> And, Tyler - Use of capital letters at start of sentences, please!

## System Requirements	

- [x] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [ ] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome

> End-user section should be a description of a typical end-user, and specific needs they have (e.g. for usability, etc.) - see the exemplars

> Proposed Solution should be a list of features you think the system should have - please see the exemplars

> Implications should include Functionality, and probably Aesthetics


## Database Structure	

- [ ] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

> This design is incomplete / not right!


## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.

> Where is this? Should be started by now


## System Testing

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **E** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  


## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **M** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
