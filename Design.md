# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **DeckBuilder/budgeter for TCG**

Project Author: **Tyler Eggers**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

deck building in TCG's can be hard and so can budgeting,not everyone has hundreds upon hundreds of dollars lying around or not too good a keeping track of things, some people might need help budgeting or planning

### End-User Requirements


### Proposed Solution

my system should allow people to build TCG decks and allow people to put themselves on a budget, making it easier for people to build decks 

-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### USABILITY

is it easy to use, will people need much time to figure out how it works, will a people of variety of ages/backgrounds be able to use my website.

people of all ages and backgrounds play TCGs(trading card games), but they might not have a lot of money lying around, these people also might not have the most  experience with technology, having an easy to use website would mean more people would be able to use it.

I will need to consider the type of people who will use my website, what kind of technological experience/ access they have and how i might adjust to their needs,I will need to make sure to apply nielson's usability heuristics to the best of my ability like match between the system and real world, user control and freedom, error prevention and consistency and standards.

### END USER IMPLICATION

who are the end users and what of their needs do I need to meet whether be what they can use, education level, any disabilities and any particular interests.

people of any age and ability can play TCGs, this is why i need to make sure to consider every type of person who will be using this website, what they might want from me, what issues they might have and what technology they can use. 

I may need to consider who will use it and what kind of education, technological skills and what devices they have, this could include using very basic words and commands, making the system simpler to use and everything comes with instructions, modifying so it can work on phones and making sure the intended audience like it  .

### LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

what laws apply to the website i'm creating, what laws might I break or need to pay attention to, how should I avoid copy right.

as i'm using assets that might not belong to me i need to properly credit the proper authors, I also need to think about what data im acquiring and how I need to protect it.

I will need to take into consideration the copy right laws of new zealand and the privacy and data protection act, i will also need to look into an other laws that might apply.

### FUNCTIONALITY IMPLICATIONS

Does everything work properly, are there any majors bugs/ glitches that could break the website

functionality is important to any and all websites because you cant not have a working website

I will need to make sure that I double check everything, testing everything for bugs, I will also need my end user to do some double checking for me because they may think of something I haven't

### INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IMPLICATIONS

what will require permission and what is free use, who will I need to credit and what for 

It is important because I am cannot claim everything my website uses and I will need to give proper credit where needed

I will need to keep track of what I use and who it belongs to, I will also need to be careful to credit them properly
-------------------------------------------------

## UX principles

### USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
this is important because I need to allow my users some control, so they can undo/ back out of actions

I will need to make sure I always have ways for users to undo/ redo/ cancel actions or go back pages so they are never trapped

### MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND REAL WORLD
this is important because a lot of people build decks in certain styles in real life, I should think of all the ways that people sort things out and how they do things

I will need to make sure I allow the users to sort out the cards in different styles just like they do in real life and make sure it feels like how it does in real life

### CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
I don't want my website to be hard to use or navigate so keeping it consistent with similar style layouts to other websites would make it easier to use

I might need to compare to other websites to make sure it doesn't feel really different and make it harder to use for my end user
