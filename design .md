## Relevant Implications

### USABILITY

is it easy to use, will people need much time to figure out how it works, will a people of variety of ages/backgrounds be able to use my website

people of all ages and backgrounds play TCGs(trading card games), but they might not have a lot of money lying around, these people also might not have the most  experience with technology, having an easy to use website would mean more people would be able to use it

i will need to consider the type of people who will use my website, what kind of technological experience/ access they have and how i might adjust to their needs
